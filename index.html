      <h1 class="title">Hello! I'm João Oliveira.</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I've been working on some exciting products at
        <a href="https://github.com/syngenta-digital">Syngenta Digital</a>! I
        love technology and how we can use our imagination with it to build
        awesome solutions for such complex problems! Currently, I'm working with
        the typescript and nodejs ecosystem, but feel free to talk with me about
        any topic outside this, for example WebGL, rust, etc... I'm really
        curious and would love to learn more about something I don't know!
